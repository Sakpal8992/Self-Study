What is server?

Computation power

OS --> AWS Linux 2
RAM --> 1GB
CPU/Processor --> 1CPU
HD --> 8GB

Server --> Only purpose i.e. Host application
OS  
RAM 
CPU/Processor 
More HD

Operating System Architecture
-----------------------------
Application --> OS --> Hardware

Linux
Less cost
More performance
More stability
Free OS
Security -> Unix principle

Linux Server --> Everything is text

os consist of
Kernel --> heart of OS
Shell
Utilities --> Packages

How to connect Linux Server
---------------------------
Authentication and Authorization

What you Know --> password
What you have --> RSA key, Tokens
What you are --> Fingerprints, palm, Retina

public key and private key in linux
code to create it --> ssh-keygen -f <file-name> tne enter 3 times then it wil be in user directry
-----------------
it will give 2 files -->public key, private key(private key are always saved in .pem file format) 

ssh --> secure shell protocol
22 (port no)

protocol port-no IP-address username password/privatekey

https://www.facebook.com:443(its default protocol no)
HTTPS 443 facebook.com username password

HTTP 80
MySQL 3306 
DNS 53
SMTP 25
tomcat 8080

Create Linux Server
-------------------
Go to EC2

1. Create a firewall/Security group
create new security group
select default vpc // inbound rule 0-6335

3.Import Public Key pair
Import setting --> name anything --> give public key --> import key pair

2.Instances
launch instances --> select AWS linux2 --> netwok same -->select default storage then hit 
launch instances
DONE

ip address

syntax to connect
-----------------
ssh -i <private-key-path> username@IP

$ -->normal user
# -->Root/Admin user
pwd --> present working directory

[command-name] [options] [input]

[options] [input] --> optional

uname --> lernel name
-<single character> = --<word>

[command name] --help

man uname --> manual

up arrow --> will give you history

ls --> list files and directories
d --> directory
- --> file

ls --> list files and directories
ls -l --> lengthy format
ls -lr --> reverse alpha order
ls -ltr --> reverse time order
ls -la --> list including hidden file and folder

CRUD --> Create Read Update Delete

Create
------
file --> touch
folder --> mkdir 
Cat > file-name
enter text
enter + ctrl + D 

cat > example.txt

em <file name> --> removes the file
rmdir -->only removes empty directories
-r --> recursive i.e. inside as well

absolute path --> /home/ec2-user/example/
relative path --> example
 > --> removes the old content and enter new content
 >> --> append to the old content
 
copy command
------------
copy source destnation
cp --> copy any file
mv --> move any file to

Lesson 2
--------
grep --> to find the text in a file
cmd line grep <word-to-find> <file-name>
Linux is case sensitive
grep -i will become insensitive

pipes are denoted by | in linux
                     -
					 
head <file-name> --> first 10 line if file by default
tail <file-name> --> last 10 lines of the file by dafault

head -n 2 <file name> --> first 2 line of the file

wget curl
---  ----

wget --> download file

wget <URL> 

curl <URL> --> it will print the file in the terminal 

cut awk
--- ---

cut command is used to cut the string based on some delimiter(ex. /, : etc)

/

cut -d : -f 1    cmd line for cut

awk -F "/" '(print $1F)'
awk -F "/" '(print $NF)'

column paste

editors
--------
VIM editors

Visually improved

vim file-name --> if the does not exists, it will create and open 
if exist it will open direct

when open the file by default you will in esc modes

vim has 3 modes
colon/cmd modes --> press : to enter 
colon option -->
-------------

:/<word-to-find> --> it will searchfor the word from top
search hit BOTTOM, co ntinuing at

search from TOP
search from BOTTOM

:? <word-to-find> --> it will search for the word from bottom

:noh --> it will unhighlight previous search code

:set nu --> to set the line no for file 

:set nonoh --> to unset the line no

:q --> quit the file comeout of the file

:q! --> it will not write what you entered and quit

:wq --> it will write what you entered and quit
:s/word-to-find/word-to-replace

sbin --> sbin-1

:s/sbin/sbin-1
it will only substitute the line where your cursir is in
:2s/sbin/sbin-1
:%s/sbin/sbin-1/g it will apply changes to whole document

ESC modes
---------

esc modes --> press esc to enter and exit
u --> to undo 
yy --> yank/copy --> copies the line
p --> paste the line
dd --> cut the line
10p --> paste for 10times
if you are in middle of the file, want to go to top g 2 times
shift+g --> takes us to bottom

insert modes --> press i to enter

Permission in linux
----------------------
R --> Read
W --> Write
X --> Execute

user/owner[u] --> the person who created the file
Group[g] --> Generally the group user belongs to or any group
Others[o] --> other than user and group

-  rw-      r--    r-- 1    ec2-user  ec2-user   1234 AAA 1 10:00 passwd
  <user>  <group> <others>   <user>   <group>
  
When you create user in Linus by default a group on the same user-name is get created
Ramesh --> DevOps Guy
devops --> remesh is part of group

-  rw-      r--    r-- 1  ramesh devops   1234 AAA 1 1:00 passwd

who can permission of a file. Either owner or root user.
chmod u+x <file-name> --> to add 
chmod U-x <file-name> --> to remove

R -->4
W -->2
X -->1

chmod 750 <file-name>

public and prvate key should not have permission more than 600


Lesson 3
------------

User Management
----------------
create user 
giving password to user
reading the user information
updating the server

for root always user id is 0.
here is also CRUD
--------------------
create user 
useradd <user-name>
Linux will start creating user from 1000, below 1000 are system user....
/etc/passwd --> user information
getent password

create password
passwd <user-name>

user should login to system

ssh -i <private-key> user-name@IP

linux disabled passwor authentication, how to enable password authentication??

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd_config is a crucial file, you should not mistake here

we take backup of ssh_config
edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd -t --> will check for the syntax

systemctl restart sshd

a taem called devops is there, you will be added to devops group

creat a group
---------------
Whenever you create user a group also created on same username
1. Primary group --> devops
2. Secondary group --> testers

groupadd <group-name>

we want to add user to the devops

usermod -g <group-name> <user-name>

create another group testers, and add testers as secondary group to user

groupadd testers

getent group --> will show the information on groups

usermod -aG testers user

gpasswd -d <user-name> <group-name>

ssh key authentication to user
------------------------------
user have to create his public and private key

share public key to admin
create a directory inside home folder of user

chmod 700 .ssh
create a file called authorised_key, paste public key of user
R -->4
W -->2
X -->

600 or 400
red and write to user
no access to group
no access to others

ownership
-----------
change the ownership to user
chown <user>:<group> file name

user is leaving organisation
-----------------------------
we need to remove him from devops group
we need to delete the user
   userdel user
   
you cant delete user from primary group  
  first you need to change his primary group to his own group
  
delete group
-------------
groupdel <group-name>
you can only delete the group if it has no user
first you should remove users from group then delete

Process Management
-------------------
joindevops.com
everything in this world is a process if you want best result you need to follow 
process

I am the root, user is the root

DAWS-70
------------------
I am the root user is root, process Instance ID 0
   chat support should reply to chat 
   for every msg they one task
     for examle ramesh sent a msg now chat support team task will be start. we will 
     create one tadk id, once chat support team complete response their task is 
	 ended.
     100 is task id it is completed. Once task is completed they should report to 
	 root
	 task id is 100, parent task is 0 
	 PID is 100, PPID is 0
   call support team should respond to call   
   
everything in linux is process, for that PID is created

list down the proess command is ps

DevOps team
  DevOps Team Leader - 0
    Senior DevOps Engineer
	    PID is 1 
		PPID is 0
	Junior DevOps Engineer
	    PID is 2
		PPID is 1
	DevOps Trainee
        PID is 3 
        PPID is 2
ps -ef --> you are teling linux to give the result of ps -ef

first it will create PID --> xxxx
xxxx is the PPID

1. Foreground Process
2. Background Process  sleep 100 &

kill <PID> --> you are requesting to end task

kill -i <PID> --> you are forcing to end the task




Package Management
----------------------
ubntu -> apt-get
centos -> yum
aws linux 2 --> amazon-linux-extra and yum

I want to install package called git

sudo amazon-linux-extra

user task will end when batch ends
